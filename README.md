# Course-Introduction

Thanks for enrolling in our course Algorithms, Part I. You can review the syllabus for an overview of the course components. The course is based on a variety of material that we have prepared over many years:
    The lecture videos, lecture slides, programming assignments, and "job interview" questions will be released weekly on the course website.
    Our textbook Algorithms, 4th edition is the basic reference for the material we will be covering. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we will assign optional readings for students who wish more extensive coverage of the material. You can purchase the textbook in either hardcover or electronic format from amazon.com.
    Our booksite[http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/], which is open to everyone and contains a wealth of supplementary information, including synopses of the textbook and Java code that you will be using throughout the course. 

To maximize your chance of success in this course, you should get in the mindset of being an active participant who writes and debugs code, solves problems, studies the available resources, and engages in the discussion forums, as opposed to a passive participant who just watches the lectures. You'll get a good feeling for the spirit and pace of the course when you work on the first programming assignment, which will introduce you to our Java programming model in the context of an important scientific application.

Union-Find

We begin our study of algorithms with a motivating example and an overview of the use of the scientific method for studying algorithm performance.

Lecture: Union−Find. We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. We introduce theunion−find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union-find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry.

Lecture: Analysis of Algorithms. The basis of our approach for analyzing the performance of algorithms is the scientific method. We begin by performing computational experiments to measure the running times of our programs. We use these measurements to develop hypotheses about performance. Next, we create mathematical models to explain their behavior. Finally, we consider analyzing the memory usage of our Java programs.

Exercises. Drill exercises on the lecture material.

Programming Assignment: Percolation. Your programming assignment will give you an opportunity to apply these concepts to a fundamental problem in physical chemistry. It is the first of many examples where a good algorithm—in this case, weighted quick union—makes the difference between being able to efficiently solve a problem and not being able to address it at all.

Job Interview Questions. Algorithmic interview questions based on the lecture material.

Suggested readings. Section 1.4 and 1.5 in Algorithms, 4th edition.
